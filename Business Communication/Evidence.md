This evidence is a certificate of completion and performance report for an interactive online module on Business Communication, which I completed with a 100% score. The module covered core principles including the purpose of business communication, verbal and non-verbal cues, formal language usage, professional email tone, and video conferencing etiquette. I successfully answered all assessment questions correctly, demonstrating a practical understanding of these concepts, and invested in this focused learning activity to build a foundational skill set for professional interactions.
