This evidence documents my successful completion of a comprehensive Workplace Etiquette online module, which I have directly applied to my professional role as a Junior Developer at Plum Systems. The module provided an in-depth exploration of professional conduct standards that are critical within our company's collaborative and client-focused environment. At Plum Systems, where we work in agile teams on sensitive client projects, this training has been instrumental in navigating daily interactions.

The curriculum covered scenarios I encounter regularly, such as managing communications with project managers and team leaders, adhering to strict sprint timelines in meetings, and handling proprietary code and client data with the utmost confidentiality. Understanding the protocols for appropriate technology use has helped me maintain focus during development sprints, while knowing the correct procedure for requesting personal time ensures I can manage unforeseen circumstances without disrupting my team's workflow. This knowledge is not theoretical; it is applied daily to maintain the professional standards and respectful atmosphere that Plum Systems is known for, directly contributing to project success and team cohesion.
