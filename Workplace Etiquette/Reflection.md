5. Workplace Etiquette

**Situation**

As I prepared to transition into professional ICT environments, I recognized that technical expertise alone would not guarantee career success. Workplace etiquette and professional conduct play equally important roles in building effective working relationships and advancing within an organization. The workplace etiquette module presented an opportunity to master the behavioral expectations and professional standards that govern successful workplace interactions across various scenarios and contexts. As a Junior Developer at Plum Systems, I quickly realized that writing efficient code was only one part of my job. To truly excel and integrate into my agile team, I needed to master the professional conduct that enables smooth collaboration, especially when working under pressure on tight deadlines for demanding clients.

**Task**

My objective was to internalize core etiquette principles to become a more reliable and effective team member. I needed to learn how to handle critical feedback on my code during code reviews professionally, understand the importance of being punctual for our daily stand-ups and sprint planning meetings, strictly adhere to our confidentiality agreements regarding client projects, manage personal distractions to maintain productivity during focused development time, and follow the correct chain of command for any personal requests. I needed to understand not just the "what" but the "why" behind etiquette standards—comprehending how these protocols support organizational harmony, professional relationships, and personal credibility.

**Action**

I applied the module's lessons directly to my daily routine at Plum Systems. When I receive a brusque email or a critical comment on a pull request, I now pause and respond professionally, seeking clarification rather than reacting defensively—this has been crucial in maintaining positive relationships with senior developers. I make it a point to join our virtual daily scrums two minutes early, ensuring I respect the team's time. I have become meticulous about not discussing client projects in open areas and using only secure channels for sharing sensitive information. I keep my personal phone in my bag during core hours to avoid distractions, and I now use the official HR portal to request time off, giving my team lead ample notice to adjust sprint allocations.

**Result**

My proactive and professional approach has been noted by my team lead in performance feedback, specifically highlighting my improved communication and reliability. By handling feedback constructively, I've accelerated my learning curve. My punctuality and respect for procedures have demonstrated that I am a dependable professional, not just a technical resource. This has not only fostered stronger, more respectful relationships with my colleagues but has also given me the confidence to engage more effectively in our fast-paced, client-driven environment, solidifying my role as a valuable contributor to the company.
