This evidence consists of completion data and performance metrics from an interactive online learning module on Professional Networking. The module covered essential networking principles and strategies, including the core purpose of professional networking, understanding networking events, fundamental rules of engagement, common pitfalls to avoid, and initial steps for building a professional network. I completed the module with a perfect 100% score, demonstrating comprehensive understanding of all key concepts, and invested 24 minutes and 36 seconds in mastering this critical professional development skill. The assessment results show consistent accuracy across all question types, from identifying the golden rule of networking as building genuine relationships to recognizing that immediate self-promotion is a common networking mistake to avoid.
