2. Interview Skills

**Situation**

As part of my professional development in work readiness training, I needed to build competency in job interview techniques to prepare for future career opportunities in the ICT field. The interview skills module presented a challenging learning environment where initial misunderstandings could be immediately identified and corrected.

**Task**

My objective was to complete the interview skills training module and demonstrate proficiency in core interview concepts, including understanding interview purposes, applying structured response frameworks, conducting effective company research, and formulating strong answers to common behavioral questions. The adaptive nature of the assessment required me to learn from initial mistakes and demonstrate corrected understanding.

**Action**

I engaged systematically with the interview skills content, focusing on practical application of concepts like the CAR (Context, Action, Result) method for structuring answers. When I encountered questions where my initial understanding was incorrect - particularly around interview purposes, company research rationale, and framing weaknesses - I analyzed the feedback, reviewed the underlying principles, and immediately applied the corrected knowledge to achieve perfect scores on all second attempts. This iterative approach allowed me to transform misunderstandings into solid comprehension.

**Result**

The outcome was an 80% module completion with demonstrated learning progression, as evidenced by correcting all initially missed concepts. More significantly, I developed a resilient understanding of interview fundamentals that will serve me in real-world scenarios. I now possess practical frameworks for preparing for company research, structuring responses using proven methods, and transforming potential weaknesses into demonstrated growth opportunities - all essential skills for successful job interviewing in the competitive ICT industry.
