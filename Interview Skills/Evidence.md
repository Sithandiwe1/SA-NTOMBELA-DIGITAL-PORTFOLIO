This evidence consists of completion data and performance metrics from an interactive online learning module on Interview Skills. The module covered essential interview preparation techniques and response strategies, including understanding interview purposes, mastering structured response methods like CAR, conducting company research, and effectively answering common behavioral questions. I completed the module with an 80% overall score, spending 21 minutes and 25 minutes engaged with the material. The assessment featured a unique learning opportunity where initial incorrect answers were followed by immediate correction and mastery, as shown in the detailed quiz results where I successfully corrected my understanding of key concepts like the primary purpose of interviews, company research importance, and effective strategies for answering "Tell me about yourself" and weakness questions on the second attempt.
