This evidence documents my participation in a comprehensive mock interview conducted earlier this year as part of the work readiness training program. The simulated interview followed a formal structure mirroring real-world IT industry interviews, featuring a panel of assessors and covering technical knowledge, behavioral competencies, and situational problem-solving questions relevant to the ICT field. I prepared extensively by researching common interview questions, reviewing my technical portfolio, and practicing the STAR response method. During the 45-minute session, I demonstrated my project experience, addressed challenging scenario-based questions, and received detailed feedback on both my strengths and areas for development, particularly in articulating technical concepts to non-technical audiences and improving my closing statements. The simulation was designed to replicate the pressure and structure of real job interviews in the ICT industry, using an innovative format where I served as both candidate and interviewer.
