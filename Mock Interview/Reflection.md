3. Mock Interview

**Situation**

As part of our work readiness program earlier this year, I participated in an innovative self-directed mock interview designed to simulate the pressure and structure of real job interviews in the ICT industry. Facing the unique challenge of creating authentic interview conditions independently, I developed a comprehensive simulation where technical and behavioral questions appeared as visual prompts, which I would read aloud before immediately recording my responses. This format created genuine pressure to think on my feet, as I encountered each question in real-time without pre-rehearsed answers, mirroring the unpredictability of actual technical interviews.

**Task**

My objective was to create and execute a professional-grade interview simulation that would test my technical knowledge, communication skills, and composure under pressure. I needed to design challenging questions comparable to those used by tech employers, then demonstrate my ability to process unfamiliar problems quickly, articulate structured responses, and maintain professional presence despite the unusual format of being both questioner and respondent. The challenge required balancing immediate comprehension of visual prompts with delivering coherent, substantive answers while managing the technical aspects of recording and self-assessment.

**Action**

I began by developing a comprehensive question bank covering technical fundamentals, behavioral scenarios, and problem-solving exercises relevant to entry-level ICT positions. For the simulation itself, I established a structured process: when each question appeared on screen, I read it aloud to create auditory reinforcement and simulate actual interview conditions, then immediately began recording my response. This approach eliminated rehearsal time and forced authentic, spontaneous answers. I maintained professional dress and setting throughout, and between questions, I quickly noted initial self-assessments regarding response clarity, technical accuracy, and areas needing improvement. The entire process required intense focus as I constantly switched between reading, processing, responding, and self-evaluating.

**Result**

This self-directed mock interview produced unexpectedly valuable outcomes. The format revealed my natural response patterns and highlighted specific areas where I struggled with immediate problem articulation. By reviewing the recordings, I identified several technical concepts that needed deeper understanding and noticed communication habits (such as filler words and rushed explanations) that required refinement. The experience dramatically improved my ability to think under pressure and organize my thoughts quickly. Most importantly, it demonstrated my proactive approach to professional development and ability to create effective learning opportunities independently - a valuable skill in the rapidly evolving ICT industry where self-directed learning is essential for career growth.
